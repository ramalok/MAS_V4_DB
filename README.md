### DESCRIPTION

    Sanger environmental marine sequences of the V4-V5 regions, retrieved until January 2010. 
    Classified to class-level using phylogenetic trees

    8903 sequences, about 500 bp in size


### SOURCE 

    Based on the sequences presented in Pernice et al. 2013. PLoS ONE 8:e57170 		(http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057170)


### HISTORY OF THE DATASET

	- Initially there were 8291 Sanger sequences classified in 65 taxonomic groups
	- These were grouped at 99% with Usearch (~3304 sequences) and then were further verified with a few extra changes
	- Metazoans and fungi were downloaded from PR2, and also grouped at 99% with Usearch. This resulted in 3593 additional sequences
  	- Add stramenopiles (including MAST and MOCH clades and subclades) as in Massana et al. 2014. ISME J. 8: 854-866
  	- Adds opisthokonta including del Campo & Ruiz-Trillo 2013. Mol. Biol. Evol. 30:802â€“805


### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS	

    - Amoebozoa not separated in classes

    - Chlorophyta lacks all classes except Prasinophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae

    - Metazoa not separated in classes

    - Fungi checked individually
	      Ascomycota - Perfect
	      Basidiomicota - Perfect
	      Mucoromycota - Perfect
	      Chytridiomycota - Rather good
	      Cryptomycota - Perfect

	  There is a clade that includes all Blastocladiomycota, together with smaller clades
	  with a fraction of Entomophthoromycota, Kickxellomycota, Zoopagomycota, Chytridiomycota, 
	  and Mucoromycota
